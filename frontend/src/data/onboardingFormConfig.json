Purpose:** Coaching is an ongoing partnership focused on the coachee's personal and professional growth. Both coach and coachee will work together to identify and achieve the coachee's goals.\n\n**2. Nature of Coaching:** Coaching is a collaborative process aimed at helping the coachee realise their potential, address their aspirations, areas for development, and challenges in both personal and professional contexts. It is a positive, forward-looking approach distinct from therapy, counselling, or advice-giving. The coach is not acting as a licensed mental health professional.\n\n**3. Confidentiality:** Coaching is a confidential relationship. The coach agrees to keep all information confidential, except where required by law or for safety reasons. Any broader sharing of information will be discussed and agreed upon with the coachee.\n\n**4. Commitment:** Coaching is most effective when both parties are honest and straightforward in their communication. The coachee agrees to prepare for each session, be punctual, and actively participate. Follow-up actions agreed upon in sessions should be completed within the agreed timeframe.\n\n**5. Process:** Coaching can involve brainstorming, values clarification, goal setting, action plans, accountability, and lifestyle examination. Sessions will be scheduled regularly as per the coaching engagement and can be terminated by either party at any time.\n\n**6. Sessions:** The coach and coachee agree to meet for the number of sessions outlined in the coaching engagement, with each session lasting 60 minutes. Scheduling is a joint responsibility.\n\n**7. Cancellations:** Life can be unpredictable, and things may come up that require rescheduling a session. If either party needs to cancel an appointment, they agree to do so with at least 24 hours' notice. Sessions cancelled within 24 hours will be billed for. The cancelling party is responsible for rescheduling the session at a mutually convenient time.\n\n**8. Responsibility:** The coachee agrees to take responsibility for their own development and performance, prepare for each session, and participate actively. They understand that the coach does not have all the answers but will work with them to explore and identify ways forward.\n\n**9. Evaluation:** The coachee agrees to complete all evaluation forms during and after the final session to help assess the effectiveness of the coaching.\n\n**10. Changes:** Any agreed changes to the coaching engagement will be implemented promptly to ensure continued alignment with the coachee's goals.\n\n**11. Termination:** Either party can request termination of the agreement if there is a breakdown in the relationship, inadequate commitment, or lack of progress.",
