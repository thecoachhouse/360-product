2. Select **Competency** from dropdown
3. Enter **Question Text**: e.g., "I clearly articulate the vision for my team"
4. Choose **Assessment Type**:

   - **Peer Only**: Question appears only in peer-assessment
   - **Both**: Question appears in both assessments ‚úÖ (recommended for core questions)
5. Repeat for all questions
6. **Recommended structure:**
   - **Self-assessment**: 5 questions per competency (60 total for 12 competencies)
   - **Peer-assessment**: 3 questions per competency (36 total for 12 competencies)
   - Use "Both" for the most important questions, then add "Self Only" for deeper introspection
7. Remove questions with the X button if needed
8. Click **"Next: Preview & Save"**

**Tips:**
- Write questions from first-person perspective for self: "I clearly..."
- Write questions from third-person for peer: "This leader clearly..."
- Use consistent rating scale language (the system defaults to 0-5: "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree")
- Keep questions specific and actionable

**Example:**
```
Competency: Vision & Direction (Strategic Thinking)

Question 1: "I clearly articulate the vision for my team" [Both]
Question 2: "I translate strategic goals into actionable priorities" [Both]
Question 3: "I help others understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture" [Both]
Question 4: "I regularly reflect on whether our direction aligns with organizational strategy" [Self Only]
Question 5: "I seek input from diverse perspectives when setting direction" [Self Only]
```

### **Step 5: Preview & Save** ‚úÖ

Review your entire assessment structure before generating templates.

**What you'll see:**
- **Summary Cards**: Total counts of dimensions, competencies, self questions, peer questions
- **Structure Preview**: Hierarchical view showing:
  - Each dimension
  - Competencies within each dimension
  - Question counts per competency (Self/Peer split)

**Final checks:**
- ‚úÖ All dimensions have competencies
- ‚úÖ All competencies have questions
- ‚úÖ Question counts are balanced (e.g., 3-5 per competency)
- ‚úÖ Self-assessment has more questions than peer-assessment

**Click "‚úì Generate & Save Templates"**

**What happens:**
1. System generates **TWO** SurveyJS JSON templates:
   - **Self-Assessment Template**: All questions tagged "self" or "both"
   - **Peer-Assessment Template**: All questions tagged "peer" or "both"
2. Both templates are saved to `assessment_templates` table with:
   - `programme_id`: Linked to your selected programme
   - `template_type`: 'self' or 'peer'
   - `survey_json`: The complete SurveyJS configuration
3. Success alert appears
4. You're redirected back to Programmes page

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure Created

After saving, the database contains:

```sql
-- Two new rows in assessment_templates table
{
  programme_id: <selected_programme_id>,
  name: "Leadership Development Q1 2025 - Self Assessment",
  template_type: "self",
  survey_json: { /* SurveyJS JSON with self questions */ }
}

{
  programme_id: <selected_programme_id>,
  name: "Leadership Development Q1 2025 - Peer Assessment",
  template_type: "peer",
  survey_json: { /* SurveyJS JSON with peer questions */ }
}
```

---

## üìä SurveyJS JSON Structure Generated

The system converts your dimensions/competencies/questions into valid SurveyJS format:

```json
{
  "title": "Leadership Self-Assessment",
  "description": "Assess your own leadership capabilities",
  "completedHtml": "Thank you for completing the assessment.",
  "pages": [
    {
      "name": "strategic_thinking_page",
      "title": "Strategic Thinking",
      "description": "Ability to make sense of complexity...",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "panel",
          "name": "vision_direction_panel",
          "title": "Vision & Direction",
          "elements": [
            {
              "type": "rating",

              "title": "I clearly articulate the vision for my team",

              "rateCount": 6,
              "rateMin": 0,
              "rateMax": 5,
              "minRateDescription": "Strongly Disagree",
              "maxRateDescription": "Strongly Agree",
              "displayMode": "buttons"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "showQuestionNumbers": "on",
  "showProgressBar": true,
  "progressBarLocation": "top",
  "metadata": {

}
```

## ‚úÖ What's Next After Building Assessment?

1. **Add Coachees**: Upload participants to the programme
2. **Send Self-Assessment Links**: Coachees complete their self-assessment
3. **Coachees Nominate Peers**: They select colleagues to provide feedback
4. **Admin Reviews Nominations**: Approve and send invitations
5. **Nominees Complete Peer Assessments**: Anonymous feedback
6. **Generate Reports**: Compare self vs peer scores per competency

## üîí Security & RLS

All database operations respect existing RLS policies:

- ‚úÖ Only admins can create/edit/delete clients, programmes, and templates
- ‚úÖ Coachees can only view templates for their own programme
- ‚úÖ Nominees can only view templates for programmes they're assessing

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No programmes available without templates"
- You need to create a programme first
- Or the programme already has templates (you can delete them via Supabase UI if testing)

### "Please create at least one client before creating programmes"
- Create a client first in the Clients section

### Can't save templates
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in `.env`
- Ensure admin role is set correctly in user_metadata

### Templates not appearing in database
- Check the `assessment_templates` table in Supabase
- Look for rows with your `programme_id`
- Both `self` and `peer` templates should be created together

---
